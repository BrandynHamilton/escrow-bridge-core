# ðŸŒ‰ EscrowBridge

**EscrowBridge** is a smart contract and listener system that enables trust-minimized, verifiable escrow of payments using off-chain attestations (PayPal) confirmed by the ChainSettle oracle and finalized on-chain.

It allows users to initiate escrowed payments, which are automatically released once ChainSettle confirms the associated off-chain event. The backend monitors for `PaymentInitialized` events and finalizes payments once confirmed.

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **EscrowBridge.sol**: ERC20-compatible smart contract that manages escrow lifecycle.
- **EscrowBridgeETH.sol**: Native gas token compatible smart contract that manages escrow lifecycle.
- **Python Listener**: FastAPI service that listens for on-chain events, polls escrow completion, triggers settlement, and exposes API endpoints.
- **CLI**: Command line interface to initiate payments and view statuses.
